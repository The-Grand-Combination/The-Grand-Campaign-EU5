# The Grand Campaign Code of Conduct & Rules

If you believe someone is violating the rules, we ask that you report it by [submitting a staff support ticket](https://discord.com/channels/1443389592601497602/1444069629382103121/1444476873944858654).

1. Treat people with respect. No harassment, witch hunting, or any form of discrimination. Banter is of course allowed, but blatant personal insults are not.
2. No doxxing or otherwise attempting to track down someone's personal identity under any circumstances may it be public or private. Breach of this rule results in an instant ban, without discussion. The exception is the case of a self-dox where we will warn you once not to do this again, for your own safety, but a second breach will still result in a ban.
3. No spam or self-promotion (server invites, advertisements, etc.) without permission from a staff member. This includes messaging fellow members without previous authorization from them. For a server partnership please also contact a staff member.
4. No NSFW, obscene or otherwise shocking content. If you would not show it to your family don't show it here.
5. The mod is under development and far from everything is finished, constructive criticism is welcomed, but non-constructive hate-posting is not.
6. Modern-day political discussions are banned. We realize the topic is not totally unavoidable considering the scope of both the game and mod, but it should at the very least be limited to era-relevant political discussions and it must be kept civil at all circumstances.
7. Any violation of the GitHub Community Guidelines (https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines) also counts as a breach of these rules.
