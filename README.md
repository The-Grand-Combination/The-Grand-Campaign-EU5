# The Grand Campaign

**The Grand Campaign** is an ambitious total conversion mod for *Europa Universalis V* that aims to bring the Victorian Era (1836–1936) to the new game.

Born as a synthesis between the legacy of *Victoria II* and the modern architecture of Victoria 3, this project seeks to create the definitive Victorian simulation, with the aim to bridge the gap between the mechanical depth of the classics and the robustness of the modern engine.

### A True Victorian Map
Given the standard for location granularity in the base game, we will reconstruct the world for an 1836 start date with an unprecedented amount of detail only seen since the days of TGC for Victoria II.
*   **Granular Borders:** Restoration of historical borders and granularity previously impossible in past titles due to province limits.
*   **Accurate Demographics:** A population model based on historical 1836 census data, with a wealth of cultures, languages, and religions.
*   **Industrial-Era Resources:** A complete overhaul of the goods tree to include rubber, oil, electricity, and other goods that fueled this period.
